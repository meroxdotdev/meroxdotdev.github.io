| Provider | Instance | Specs | Location | Purpose |
|:---------|:---------|:------|:---------|:--------|
| **Hetzner** | CX32 | 4vCPU/8GB/80GB | ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Germany | Off-site Backup |
| **Oracle** | Ampere A1 | 4vCPU/24GB/200GB | ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ USA | Docker Test |


##  Network Architecture

### Simple but Effective Design

I've kept my network intentionally simple - no VLANs or complex routing (yet). Three dedicated physical interfaces on pfSense handle everything:

```
WAN Interface â†’ Orange ISP (Bridge Mode)
LAN Interface â†’ Homelab Network
WiFi Interface â†’ Guest/IoT Isolation
```

> **Security Note:** WiFi clients are firewalled from homelab services, except whitelisted ones like Jellyfin
{: .prompt-warning }

### Network Topology

*Click to enlarge - Full network topology including Tailscale mesh connections*

> **Geo-distributed Exit Nodes:** Both VPS instances double as Tailscale exit nodes, allowing me to route traffic through EU (Hetzner) or US (Oracle) regions for geo-restricted content or better latency.


## Selfhosted Apps

### pfSense


The heart of my network - a fanless mini PC from AliExpress (~100â‚¬) running pfSense for 3+ years:

#### Tailscale Subnet Router
Exposes the entire homelab to cloud VPS without installing Tailscale on every device. Perfect solution for CGNAT bypass.

[Setup guide â†’](https://merox.dev/blog/tailscale-site-to-site/)

#### Unbound DNS
Local recursive resolver with domain overrides for `*.k8s.merox.dev` pointing to K8s-Gateway.

#### Telegraf
Pushes system metrics to Grafana for monitoring dashboards.

#### Network Security
- **WiFi â†’ LAN**: Block all except some self-hosted apps
- **LAN â†’ WAN**: Allow all  
- **WAN â†’ Internal**: Block all except exposed services


### UPS #2

Managing power for the critical infrastructure - the CyberPower 1000VA protects all mini PCs and network equipment:

#### Power Management Features

| Feature | Implementation | Purpose |
|:--------|:---------------|:--------|
| **pwrstat** | USB to GTi13 Pro | Automated shutdown orchestration |
| **SSH Scripts** | Custom automation | Graceful cluster shutdown |
| **Monitoring** | Telegram alerts | Real-time power notifications |

![UPS monitoring dashboard](/assets/img/posts/ups.png)

> **Safety First:** When power fails, the UPS triggers a cascading shutdown sequence - K8s nodes drain properly before Proxmox hosts power down
{: .prompt-warning }

#### Telegram Integration

Instant notifications keep me informed of power events wherever I am:

![Telegram UPS notification](/assets/img/posts/telegram-notif1.jpeg)

### Synology DS223+

The reliable storage backbone - serving dual purposes in my infrastructure:

#### Media Storage
- **Protocol**: SMB/NFS shares (experimenting with both)
- **Purpose**: Central storage for ARR stack
- **Access**: Mounted directly in K8s pods and Docker containers

#### Personal Cloud
After 3 years of self-hosting Nextcloud, I switched to Synology Drive for a more polished experience:

- âœ… **Better performance** than my Nextcloud instance
- âœ… **Native mobile apps** that actually work reliably
- âœ… **Set-and-forget** reliability for family photos/documents
- âœ… **2TB RAID1** protection for peace of mind

![Synology services overview](/assets/img/posts/synology.png)

> **Experience Note:** Sometimes the best self-hosted solution is the one that requires the least maintenance. Synology Drive has been that for my personal files.

### Test Enterprise Server (Dell R720)

The power-hungry beast of the homelab - this old datacenter workhorse has served many purposes over the past year:

#### Evolution of Use Cases

| Period | Purpose | Configuration | Notes |
|:-------|:--------|:--------------|:------|
| **Phase 1** | Proxmox hypervisor | 24C/48T, 192GB RAM | Raw performance testing |
| **Phase 2** | AI Playground | Quadro P2200 GPU | Ollama + Open WebUI |
| **Current** | Backup Target | 4Ã— 960GB RAID-Z2 | Weekly MinIO sync |

#### Hardware Modifications

The most interesting project was **flashing the RAID controller to IT mode** - completely bypassing hardware RAID for direct disk access:

> **Guide:** For H710/H310 crossflashing instructions, check out [Fohdeesha's excellent guide](https://fohdeesha.com/docs/perc.html)
{: .prompt-tip }

#### Remote Management

iDRAC Enterprise makes this server a joy to manage remotely:

![iDRAC management interface](/assets/img/posts/idrac-dellr720.png)

#### Current Role: Off-site Backup Target

Given the ~200W idle power consumption, I've implemented a smart scheduling system:

-  **Power Schedule**: Wake-on-LAN 1-2Ã— weekly
-  **Sync Task**: Pull MinIO backups from Hetzner VPS
-  **Storage**: RAID-Z2 for redundancy
-  **3-2-1 Rule**: Completes my backup strategy

> **Power Efficiency Note:** Running 24/7 would cost ~â‚¬20/month in electricity.
{: .prompt-warning }

*Still constantly changing my mind about what to run here*


### Proxmox

The compute playground of my homelab - a small but mighty 3-node cluster spread across my mini PCs.

![Proxmox cluster overview](/assets/img/posts/proxmox.png)

> **Philosophy Change:** I've simplified from my previous complex setup. Rather than managing dozens of VMs/containers, I now focus on quality over quantity - running only what truly adds value.
{: .prompt-info }

#### Current Virtual Machines

| VM | Purpose | Specs | Notes |
|:---|:--------|:------|:------|
| **3Ã— Talos K8s** | Kubernetes nodes | 4vCPU/16GB/1TB | Intel iGPU passthrough |
| **meroxos** | Docker playground | 4vCPU/8GB/500GB | K8s alternative for simpler services |
| **Windows Server 2019** | AD Lab | 4vCPU/8GB/100GB | Active Directory experiments |
| **Windows 11** | Remote desktop | 4vCPU/8GB/50GB | Always-ready Windows machine |
| **Home Assistant** | Home automation | 2vCPU/4GB/32GB | See automation section below |
| **Kali Linux** | Security testing | 2vCPU/4GB/50GB | *To be restored from PBS* |
| **GNS3** | Network lab | 4vCPU/8GB/100GB | *To be restored from PBS* |

#### Smart Home Integration

While I have various IoT devices, my Home Assistant setup is intentionally minimal. The most interesting automation? **Location-based server fan control**:

-  **Phone at home** â†’ Dell R720 fans run quieter
-  **Away from home** â†’ Fans ramp up for better cooling

> **Pro tip:** For Dell R720 fan control details, check out my [dedicated post](http://merox.dev/blog/dell-r720/)
{: .prompt-tip }

#### Infrastructure Distribution

Each Proxmox node runs one Talos VM, ensuring:
- High availability across physical hosts
- Balanced resource utilization  
- No single point of failure for Kubernetes


### Cloud Machines

Extending beyond the homelab walls - strategic cloud deployments for resilience and global reach:

![Hetzner cloud dashboard](/assets/img/posts/hetzner.png)

#### Infrastructure Overview

All managed through a single Portainer instance at `cloud.merox.dev`:

![Portainer multi-cluster view](/assets/img/posts/clusters.png)

> **Cost Optimization:** Hetzner's CX32 at ~â‚¬8/month provides the perfect balance of resources for 24/7 operations
{: .prompt-tip }

#### cloud-de (Hetzner VPS)

The always-on sentinel watching over my homelab:

| Service | Container | Purpose |
|:--------|:----------|:--------|
| **Monitoring Stack** | Grafana, Prometheus, Alertmanager | External homelab monitoring |
| **Pi-hole** | DNS resolver | Dedicated Tailscale split-DNS |
| **Traefik** | Reverse proxy | SSL certificates for all VPS services |
| **Guacamole** | Remote access | Cloudflare Tunnel exposed |
| **Firefox** | Browser container | GUI access via Guacamole RDP |

> **Reliability First:** When the homelab is down, this VPS ensures I can still access critical services and troubleshoot remotely
{: .prompt-warning }

#### homelab-ro (Local Docker)

The emergency escape hatch - when Kubernetes complexity becomes too much:

| Service | Purpose | Note |
|:--------|:--------|:-----|
| **ARR Stack** | Media automation | Quick restore when K8s fails |
| **Netboot.xyz** | PXE server | Network boot any OS/tools |
| **Portainer Agent** | Management | Remote Docker control |

*Because sometimes you just need things to work without debugging YAML manifests at 2 AM*

#### cloud-usa (Oracle Free Tier)

The wildcard instance leveraging Oracle's generous free tier:

- **Testing ground** for experimental Docker images
- **Tailscale exit node** for US geo-location
- **Not in Portainer** - hit the 5-node limit (3Ã— K8s + 2Ã— Docker)

> **Free Tier Limits:** Portainer BE restricts to 5 nodes. Priority given to production workloads over test instances.
{: .prompt-info }

#### k8s (Kubernetes Cluster)

*My guilty pleasure* - because who doesn't love over-engineering their homelab?

- **Portainer integration** for centralized overview
- **Quick health checks** without kubectl
- **Detailed coverage** in the dedicated K8s section below

> **Architecture Note:** Each cloud instance serves as a Tailscale subnet router, creating a global mesh network with automatic failover capabilities
{: .prompt-tip }

### Talos & Kubernetes

- CI/CD based on onedr0p/cluster-template:
  - https://github.com/meroxdotdev/infrastructure 
  - specific added for my usecase:
    - longhorn (with MinIO backup on Hetzner VPS & Storagebox)
    - grafana & kube-prometetheus stack
    - Arr stack ( analog to meroxos VM)
    - dashboard homepage
