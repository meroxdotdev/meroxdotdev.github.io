During my business trip to Warsaw, I had the unique opportunity to visit Google's impressive offices. Here's an inside look at their workspace, from panoramic views to relaxation zones.

## A Business Trip Turned Into a Tech Adventure

My trip to Warsaw originally revolved around **discussions on the design of HPC (High-Performance Computing) infrastructure** at my company. However, it also turned into an exciting experience when a friend working at **Google** invited me to visit their **Warsaw HUB offices**. This was an opportunity I couldn't pass up!

## Google's Expansion in Warsaw

Google has heavily invested in Poland, establishing **Google Cloud's first Central and Eastern European region** in Warsaw. The **Google Warsaw HUB** spans **14 floors** of the Warsaw HUB skyscraper complex, reinforcing the city's status as a key tech hub in Europe.

## Stepping Into Google's Office

Upon arrival, I received a **guest badge**, which allowed me to move freely within designated areas.

### The Elevators: More Than Just Transportation

The **elevator hall** was eye-catching, illuminated in **Google's signature colors**. Inside the elevator, a screen displayed the **building's floor plan**, showing which Google departments were located at each level.

## The Coffee Corner: A Relaxing Break Area

One of the standout spaces was the **Coffee corner**, a relaxed environment where employees could grab **free snacks and drinks**. The space even had **mixing stations with DJ equipment**!

## The Restaurant: A Missed Opportunity

Google provides free meals for employees and, on some occasions, even for visitors. Unfortunately, by the time I got there, the restaurant had closed for the day.

Google's focus on employee well-being was evident throughout the office. Among the highlights:

- **Power nap rooms** for quick relaxation

- A **fully-equipped gym on the top floor**, available to all employees

## Conclusion: A Workplace Designed for Productivity and Comfort

Visiting Google's Warsaw HUB was an eye-opening experience. The combination of **cutting-edge technology, modern workspace design, and thoughtful employee perks** made it clear why Google is considered one of the best places to work.
