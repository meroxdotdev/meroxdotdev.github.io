## üëã Hello, I'm Robert

I'm a **DevOps-focused HPC System Administrator** and former **Cybersecurity Engineer** with **9+ years of experience** building secure, scalable, and high-performance IT infrastructures. My passion lies in leveraging **automation**, **cloud technology**, and **containerization** to solve complex infrastructure challenges.

Currently serving as an **HPC System Administrator** at Forvia, where I manage enterprise-grade HPC environments, coordinate datacenter deployment activities, and collaborate with cross-functional IT teams for demanding computational workloads.

## üöÄ Core Expertise

| **Focus Area** | **Key Activities** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **HPC Infrastructure & Operations** | Coordinating datacenter deployment activities (server racking, patching, cabling), collaborating with network/firewall teams for VLAN/port allocation and security flows, managing **InfiniBand** (Mellanox switches), and handling end-to-end infrastructure provisioning. |
| **Enterprise Systems Management** | Remote server deployment via **iDRAC**, OS installation and configuration, managing **SMB/NFS** shares, implementing **PBS** job scheduling, and supporting HPC applications (**CST**, **Moldflow**, **Altair**) with vendor coordination. |
| **Hybrid Cloud & Virtualization** | Designing and managing Linux/Windows servers, **AWS (EC2/S3)**, **Oracle Cloud (Ampere)**, **Proxmox** virtualization, and **Docker** containerization. |
| **DevOps & Automation** | Implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC), **Puppet** automation, **GitOps** workflows, and orchestrating **Kubernetes** (**K8s/K3S**) clusters with **Rancher**. |
| **Security & Network Engineering** | VLAN design coordination, firewall flow configuration, vulnerability assessments (**NESSUS**), next-gen firewall management (**Cisco, Fortinet, Palo Alto, Juniper**), and enterprise access control. |
